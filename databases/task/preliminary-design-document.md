1\.  Preliminary Database Design

1.1.  Project description, database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff

>  TODO

1.2.  Data description, generally what type of data will be stored

>  TODO

1.3.  At least five examples of the type of data your database will provide _to the user_

>  TODO

1.4.  A preliminary idea of the schema of the database including table descriptions and potential columns

>  Each task will have its information broken up into tables. The first will be called users for all the users participating in each task. Potential columns for this table will be the username, photo, and other relevant user data. Another table will be made called statistics which will track all the progress being made by the group members. This will inlude info about what the goals are
 and if weekly or daily goals are kept. 
 
1.5.  A complete preliminary Entity-Relationship Diagram [ERD] for the database [NOT hand-drawn, PLEASE!]
