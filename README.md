# BetterWe
An app designed to keep friends accountable for their goals. Developed by James Byrne, Sam Chami, Sam Savini, and John Scott.

## Proposal
The idea behind BetterWe is to make an phone app where you can achieve goals with your friends in fun ways while keeping each other accountable. It could be used for a group going on a diet, exercising regularly, or other custom activities. There are other apps that cover accountability already on the market. These apps often act as a personal trainer or are geared towards teams in a business. They tend to be geared towards individuals, and when they are intended for group use, they focus on groups in business. The apps are more serious than fun. BetterWe is looking to replace the group chats that you have with your friends about keeping up with each other about activities you are doing together. It will have features like location check in at places like the gym, a panic button in case you are tempted by a delicious looking cookie so that your friends can help you out, and a fun way to call out your friends for not doing what they should be. The technologies used for this app will be React Native for the app and Apache Cassandra for the database. New technologies will be added as we expand on our features. If we include location check in as a feature, we will use the Google Maps API.

There are two main reasons that we decided to use react native to write our app in. The first is that we are all already familiar with javascript which react native is based off of. The second reason is the platforms that react native can run on. It can run on iphones and Androids. It can also be more easily converted to a website than if we wrote it in Swift or Java. This app will have a database of messages, user profiles, and activity profiles, which will go well tie into our database project. We chose to use Apache Cassandra for our database because it seems like a good choice for group messenger type applications. This project has enough technical difficulty that it can span the course of one semester, and even two semesters if we want to make a website version or more features. At this appâ€™s core, it is a glorified group messenger app. This means that we can focus on making the core of the app then expand outward with features as time allows. All of the group members can see potential uses for this app in their and their friends lives so it pertains to all of us, and hopefully to other users.
